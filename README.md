# DeepSpeech model for Swedish ASR

Our fork of [Mozilla's DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) can be found in the `v0.6.1-thesis` branch of this repository. Notably, we have added a flag to help with transfer learning. It allows taking a checkpoint with x output nodes to output a new checkpoint with y output nodes. This enables transfering from one alphabet to another.

Our Swedish ASR model can be found in the Releases page of this repository.
